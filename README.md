# Blog ON

Blogs are a type of regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word
blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply
an online diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web. They have
since morphed into an essential forum for individuals and businesses alike to share information
and updates. In fact, many people even make money blogging as professional full-time bloggers.

As the publishing world has evolved, and more of it has moved online, blogs have come to
occupy a central position in this digital content world. Blogs are a source of knowledge, opinion
and concrete advice. While not yet posed to replace journalism as an art form, people
increasingly look to trusted blogs to find answers to their questions, or to learn how to do
something.

Blogs are always evolving both in terms of how they're created and what they are used for. They
can be a vehicle for creativity and for marketing. They're also increasingly created and read on
mobile apps, as mobile blogging also comes into its own.
